                Founded in Baghdad, Iraq in the 9th Century CE, during the Islamic Golden Age, the House of Wisdom (also known as Bayt al-Hikmah or Khizānat al-Ḥikmah) was not just a library, but a center of scholarship in the ancient world. 
            </p>
            <h2 style="clear:right">What was in the Library?</h2>
            <figure class="section-image even">
              <div class="clearfix">
                <img alt="An illustration of Baghdad in the medieval era. The city was circular." src="https://www.1001inventions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/house-wisdom-03.jpg" />

            </figure>
            <p>
               Although we do not have access to the texts that were in the library, documents from the time say that the House of Wisdom had materials focused on religion, history, scientific knowledge, medicine, and more. One of its special focuses was translation, as well, with scholars  translating books from Persian to Arabic.

            <h2>Tell me it didn't burn down...</h2>
            <p>
                It did not! But unfortunately, the capital of Iraq changed from Baghdad to another city, Sāmarrā’, leading to a decline in the library. It stops being mentioned in historical texts in 833 CE, and according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, “whatever may have remained of the collection in 1258 was destroyed in the Mongol sack of Baghdad.” But the library was not forgotten, and it led many other influential figures in early Islamic history to build libraries and centers of knowledge.</a>
